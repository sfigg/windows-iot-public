# Unified Write Filter
The [Unified Write Filter (UWF)](/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/unified-write-filter#turn-on-and-configure-uwf) is a Windows IoT Enterprise feature that helps to protect your drives by intercepting and redirecting any writes to the drive (app installations, settings changes, saved data) to a virtual overlay. The virtual overlay is a temporary location that is usually cleared during a reboot or when a guest user logs off.

The Unified Write Filter is useful in the following scenarios:
* Isolating writes to extend the life of storage media
* Optimizing Application load timing on boot â€“ it can be faster to resume from a HORM file on every boot rather than reloading the system on each boot
* Resetting systems like Thin Clients, which are used in shared workspaces (e.g. schools, libraries, hotels, etc.) with frequent guests to ensure each guest receives a clean experience


## Install the Unified Write Filter
The Unified Write Filter (UWF) is an optional Windows feature. So in order to use UWF, you'll first need to install the feature.

* [Turn on UWF on a running PC](/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/uwf-turnonuwf#turn-on-uwf-on-a-running-pc)
* [Install UWF on a customized Windows Image](/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/uwf-turnonuwf#install-uwf-on-a-customized-windows-image)
* [Install the UWF feature by using Windows Configuration Designer](/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/uwf-turnonuwf#install-the-uwf-feature-by-using-windows-configuration-designer)
* [Install the UWF feature by using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)](/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/uwf-turnonuwf#install-the-uwf-feature-by-using-windows-management-instrumentation-wmi)

Next, you'll enable (and optionally configure) the feature.

The first time you enable UWF on your device, UWF makes the following changes to your system to improve the performance of UWF:
* Paging files are disabled.
* System restore is disabled.
* SuperFetch is disabled.
* File indexing service is turned off.
* Fast boot is disabled.
* Defragmentation service is turned off.
* BCD setting **bootstatuspolicy** is set to **ignoreallfailures**.

After UWF is enabled, you can select a drive to protect and start using UWF.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can install UWF for running PCs and devices, prepare it for customized Windows images, or manage it remotely using CSP or WMI.

## New Capabilities - 21H2
With [Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, version 21H2](/windows/iot/product-family/what's-new-in-windows-10-iot-enterprise-21h2), a new set of capabilities have been introduced to the Unified Write Filter.

1. [UWF Swapfile Created on Any Volume](/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/uwf-wes7-ewf-to-win10-uwf)
    * Allows booting from devices susceptible to wear from writings (e.g. SSD)
    * Redirects Disk overlay to other media


2. [Read Only Mode (ROM) Mode](/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/uwf-wes7-ewf-to-win10-uwf#read-only-media-mode)  
    * Allows elimination to physical devices
    * Official successor to WES7 Enhanced Write Filter


3. [Full Volume Commit in ROM Mode](/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/uwf-wes7-ewf-to-win10-uwf#full-volume-commit-in-read-only-media-mode)
    * Ability to commit entire state of UWF protected volumes to physical disk at once.
